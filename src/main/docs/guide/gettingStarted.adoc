In this guide you are going to create a combined build of the `server` and `client` projects from the React profile. By default the React profile sets up separate frontend and backend apps, which can make for a more efficient development process. However this may not fit your deployment needs, particularly if your entire app is being deployed to a servlet container such as Tomcat, or being executed as a "fat" JAR. Thanks to the flexiblity of Grails and the Gradle build tool, we can configure a unified build of our Grails/React app with only a few changes.
